      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        With the recent migrant crisis impacting Europe and the world on an unprecedented scale, our mission is to contribute to the process of integration of refugees into these communities through innovation and technology. Refugees face a number of tough challenges once their asylum status has been obtained, but one of the most critical and most burdensome problems for European nations medium to longer term will be that of economic integration through job opportunity. Our organization aims to tackle this by providing refugees with opportunities to learn and connect with through computer literacy and code. Through action and example, we hope to break down stereotypes about these individuals and highlight their potential for contributing to their host country.

        These workshops have helped me to get deeper insight into web development. [Participant, Summer 2016]

        It was a very good method that [helped] me [to] learn coding, which before I didn’t dare to do by my own. I would like to thank everyone who participated in making this workshop possible especially Dustin, Jean and Larissa. [Participant, Summer 2016]
      </div>
      <div>
        Personally, they have helped me to have a foundation [in programming] that is an essential part of my master's degree right now. For those who want to master a good level of coding and who need practice and motivation, I recommend [the workshops]. (translated from French) [Maya, from Syria, Summer and Fall 2016]
      </div>
      <div>
        We hope to continue the program, because we hope to not stop at 10 sessions. We are eager to learn and catch up! (translated from French) [Participant, Summer 2016]
      </div>
      <div>
        Before I thought not everyone could learn how to design web sites because it seemed difficult for me, however thanks to [these] workshops I’ve discovered a lot such as the basics of web development, how to write HTML, how to style pages using CSS, and many other things concerning web design. I truly recommend this workshop to everyone. The workshops are perfectly organized and we absorb all the lessons with full understanding. I really run out of words to express how thankful and grateful I’m for all you have done for us. It’s wonderful that there are humanitarian[s] like you in this world!
